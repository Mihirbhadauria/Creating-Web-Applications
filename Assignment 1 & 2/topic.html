    <h1> What is a Search Engine?</h1>
    
    <p class="paragraphs"> A search engine is a web based tool that allows the client to search information on the internet. 
        Popular examples of them include Google and Bing. This engine searches through the World Wide Web in a systematic way to locate
        specific information given by the user  
    </p>
    
    <aside>
        <p> <strong> Did You Know</strong> that the first search engine was created in 1990 by Alan Emtage called "Archie" </p>
        <img src="https://www.seobythesea.com/wp-content/first-search-engine-archie.jpg" alt="Archie" > 

    </aside>

    <h2 id="t_heading"> How do they work?</h2>
    <p id="t_paragraph"> Every search engine have unique and complex mathematical formulas to generate search results. Search engines take into account of lot variables
        in a webpage such as page title, keywords and etc which dictate where the webpage sits in terms of ranking within a list derived from the search query

<h3 id=Future> The Future of Search Engines</h3>

<p class="sumpara"> Search engines have often been associated by searches via text however with technology
            gradually improving and progressing inputs such as images and voice are gradually
            becoming mainstream in terms of web usuage.
</p>

<p class="sumpara">Common Examples Include:</p>

<ul>
    <li class="inside">Text Search</li>
    <li class="inside">Image Search </li>
    <li class="inside" >Voice Search</li>
</ul>

<p class="sumpara">There are more different types of technology however most stem 
    from these categories. Currently Voice search or "Voice Assistants" are gradually becoming the norm. I will
    list the types of search each big company has so far
</p>

<ol class="olist">
    <li> <strong>Google</strong>
        <ul>
           <li> Google Search Engine </li>
           <li> Google Home (voice assistant)</li>
           <li> Google Image Search</li>
        </ul>
<br>
    <li> <strong>Amazon</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li> Amazon Online Search Engine (text)</li>
            <li> Amazon Alexa (voice assistant)</li>
            <li> Amazon Online Image Search</li>
        </ul>
<br>
    <li> <strong> Microsoft</strong>
        <ul> 
            <li>Bing Search Engine</li>
            <li>Cortana (voice assistant)</li>
            <li>Bing Visual Search</li>
        </ul>  
</ol>   
<p class="sumpara"> It is apparent that all these big tech giants are trying to diversify
    a variety of search methods which mainly consist on the categories of 
    text, voice and image. The voice assistants in particular are gradually getting programmed better
    and will sooner or later render standard web search engines obsolete due to 
    the ease of use and the effort being placed to harness results.
